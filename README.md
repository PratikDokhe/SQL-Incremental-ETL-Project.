# SQL-Incremental-ETL-Project.
Building a Incremental ETL for E-Commerce Sales Data using SQL_Server





### Business Requirement / Problem Statement
 An online retailer needs to centralize daily sales data into a reporting database. Source data arrives
 each day as CSV extracts from legacy systems. Your task is to design and implement an incremental
 ETL process that: 

 • Extracts new and changed records from source CSVs

 • Cleans common data issues (invalid formats, missing values, duplicates)

 • Loads the transformed data into staging tables, then merges into target tables

 • Maintains a high-watermark (e.g. last loaded order_date) to support incremental loads.
